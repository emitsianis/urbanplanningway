        Welcome to Urban Planning Way's official website! As you might have
        noticed, cities and buildings are becoming uglier and more energy
        consuming by the minute. But that is about to change. With our highly
        proffessional team of proffessionals you can forget about cities that
        are harder to climb than mt. Everest and 1000 euro electricity bills.
        <br />
        But the real question is: What can we do for <strong>YOU?</strong> Let's
        explore!

      <div class="text-container" id="about">
        Urban Planning Way inc. was established in 2018 by our ambitious and
        insightful leader Kelly Way. Like all of the world's greatest companies
        and inventions, it all started with a simple idea: <br /><br />
        <span class="it"
          >What if university assignements are not actually enough to get you a
          job?</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        Dissapointed from the lack of interest in the market, Kelly decided to
        invest in that idea and start her own urban planning company. Little did
        she know at that time, that this would be a decision to be written down
        in history.

      <div
        class="parallax"
        data-parallax="scroll"
        data-image-src="img/2.jpg"
        data-z-index="100"
      ></div>
      <div class="text-container" id="skills">
        This is the part where any normal company would display a list of
        services, and give you reasons as to why you should preffer that company
        over their competition. We are not going to do that. <br /><br />
        Meeting with any member of Urban Planning Way, you will be quick to
        realise that we don't actually know what we can do and what services we
        offer. To us, our work is an idea, it holds a higher meaning than
        concrete facts or concrete types that should be used on buildings.

      <div class="text-container" id="contact">
        Don't hesitate to contact us anytime if you have questions or you need
        something done. We value our relationship with people higher than
        anything, including urban planning itself (obviously). Also, in the off
        chance that you would like to work with us, send us your CV to
        <strong>hr@urbanplanningway.io</strong>, so that we can schedule an
        interview. Be prepared though, if you can describe your skills in a
        structured fashion and you are able to be convincing, it is highly
        unlikely that you will get hired.
